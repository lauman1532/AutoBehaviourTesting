# Automated Mouse Behaviour Testing System

The Automated Mouse Behaviour Testing System is a cost-effective, automated home-cage that permits handling-free individual mice testing developed by eight undergraduates from Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London.

This automated system aims to minimise human factors, to save researchers time, and to allow regular monitoring of performance of individual mice.
